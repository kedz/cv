      \textit{Machine Learning Researcher} & \textit{Jan. 2021 -- Dec. 2022}\\
    \end{tabular*}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=4.5mm]
      \item \textbf{Contributor to the Rasa framework.} Designed and implemented a template-based response generation system on top of an ML powered conversation state manager, that enabled developers to flexibly delegate response generation to an ML dialogue manager or override with custom business logic. Wrote documentation and engaged in developer relations (YouTube videos and answering forum questions) to help introduce the feature with the developer community.  

    \end{itemize}

%~\\
%I am working on new features for the open source conversational AI/ML library
%rasa. In particular, I designed the conditional response variations feature which
%increases the flexibility of rule based response generation for conversational assistants
%built with Rasa. I also helped implement an ML model, UnexpecTED,
%to flag unusual turns in a dialogue in order to assist developers in automatically
%identifying problems with their assistant. Additionally, I lead the development of
%an internal user simulation framework that uses language models to generate user
%responses given a natural language description of a user goal. The user simulation
%framework enabled other research and engineering teams to evaluate novel
%dialogue system features quickly before needing to do more extensive human
%evaluation. I also work with product teams on discovery for new ML features.
