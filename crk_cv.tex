\NewEntry{2014-Present}{Columbia University}

\Description{\MarginText{Doctor of Philosophy}\textit{Natural Language Processing}\ \ $\cdotp$\ \ Dept. of Computer Science\ \ $\cdotp$\ \ \newline Fu Foundation School of Engineering \& Applied Science \newline
Adviser: Prof.~\textsc{Kathleen McKeown}\\
Description: With Prof. \textsc{McKeown}, I am working on event understanding from 
newswire and social media text. Specifically, we are exploring techniques
for automatically summarizing natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and 
other large-scale, catastrophic events. I am currently working on the learning
of sentence representations and similarity methods that take into account 
event causality and correlation for use in text clustering.
With Prof. \textsc{McKeown} and Dr. \textsc{Fernando Diaz} at Microsoft Research, I 
participated in the Text Retrieval Conference Temporal Summarization track,
where I experimented with regression methods for predicting important 
information to be included in automatically generated summaries.
I am also overseeing a masters student and two undergraduate students in an
effort to modernize Prof. \textsc{McKeown's} automatic news summarization 
system, Newsblaster. }

Adviser: Prof.~\textsc{Kathleen McKeown}\\
Description: 
I continued to pursue my interests in natural language processing, 
in addition to
machine learning and statistics. In Prof. \textsc{McKeown's} lab I worked on
question-answering (QA) for the DARPA BOLT (Broad Operational Language 
Translation) project. My research focused on unsupervised methods of 
text similarity and the application of semantic web/linked open data for QA.}

Description: 
While taking introductory courses in computer science, I also worked as a 
research assistant for Prof. \textsc{Kathleen McKeown} and her student, 
\textsc{Sara Rosenthal}.
Responsibilities included annotating research corpora for
supervised learning systems, developing web crawlers to extract user discussions from online forums, and building research corpora for studies in 
automatic influence and agreement detection in natural
language.}

\Description{\MarginText{Bachelor of Arts}GPA: 3.34\ \ $\cdotp$\ \ \textit{Music/Recording Arts Double Major}\ \ $\cdotp$\ \ College of Communication and Fine Arts/School of Film and Television\newline
Description: In my undergraduate degree, I pursued interests in both classical
music and sound design/mixing for film. Within the music department, I 
concetrated on
music theory/composition as well as guitar performance, culminating in two
senior theses, an original composition, \textit{String Quartet for Space
Travel}, and a guitar recital, featuring works by Antonio Lauro, Roland Dyens,
Leo Brouwer, Miguel Llobet, Antonio Vivaldi, and others. Within the film
department, I scored and sound designed/mixed many student films 
(\textit{The Cannibal Ad}, Golden Hamster(Best Overall) Award 
and 1$^{st}$ Place for Narrative Short, 2005 Northwest Projections Film 
Festival; \textit{Lily}, Best Sound, Best Film, 2007 LMU School of Film and Television ``Film Outside the
Frame Festival.'').}

\NewEntry{Nov. 2014}{Columbia U. at TREC: Temporal Summarization}

\Description{\MarginText{Temporal Summarization Track, TREC 2014}Abstract: In
this talk, I present an overview of our participation in the temporal 
summarization track at the 2014 Text REtrieval Conference. Our 
submission was one of the top overall submissions for this track.
Our performance gain came largely from our precision in the 
summary update selection stage; I outline the details of our salience
regression model and affinity propagation clustering architecture, including
their effect on our scores. I also address our current system shortcomings,
especially our inability to explicitly control for redundancy.
